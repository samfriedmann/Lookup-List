## Overview
Lookup List is a program that allows you to quickly lookup a list of words using Google Dictionary and Wikipedia.

## How to Use

NOTE: Windows thinks this program is a virus, for some reason (it isn't; I promise). Use the steps outlined [in the Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/restore-quarantined-files-microsoft-defender-antivirus) to reinstate the program if it gets removed. You can also follow [these steps](https://www.technipages.com/windows-10-how-to-exclude-a-file-from-windows-defender) to exclude it from the Windows antivirus.

Download and run lookup-list.exe. Upon first running, it will create a file called words.txt. Add the terms you wish to look up to the words.txt file and make sure to save your changes. Then run lookup-list.exe again. Enter the number of sentences to get for definitions from Wikipedia (1 will get one sentence long definitions, and so on). The program will look up definitions for all the words and write (or overwrite) them to words_defined.txt.

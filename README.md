## Overview
Lookup List is a program that allows you to quickly lookup a list of words using Google Dictionary and Wikipedia.

## How to Use
Download lookup-list.exe and words.txt. To use this Lookup List, add your words to the words.txt file in the root folder. Make sure to save your changes. Then run Lookup-List.exe. Enter the number of sentences to get for definitions (1 will get one sentence definitions, and so on). It will create (or modify) wordsDefined.txt.
